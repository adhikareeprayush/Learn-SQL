                    <h2>Indexes in SQL</h2>
                    <p>Indexes are used to retrieve data from the database more quickly than otherwise. The users cannot
                        see the indexes, they are just used to speed up searches/queries.</p>

                    <h3>Types of Indexes</h3>
                    <p>There are three types of indexes:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>- Unique Index</li>
                        <li>- Clustered Index</li>
                        <li>- Non-Clustered Index</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Unique Index</h3>
                    <p>Unique Indexes are used not just for performance but for data integrity as well, as they do not
                        allow the field to have duplicate values if the column is unique indexed.</p>

                    <h3>Clustered Index</h3>
                    <p>Clustered Indexes are the indexes that physically sort the data rows in the table on the basis of
                        their key values. There can be only one clustered index on a table.</p>

                    <h3>Non-Clustered Index</h3>
                    <p>Non-Clustered Indexes are the indexes where the logical order of the index does not match the
                        physical stored order of the rows on disk. The leaf layer of a non-clustered index does not
                        consist
                        of the data pages. Instead, the leaf nodes contain index rows.</p>

                    <h2>Query Optimization Techniques</h2>
                    <p>Query optimization is the process of selecting the most efficient way to execute a query. The
                        process of optimization is a complex one, as it involves making decisions based on the available
                        statistics and the query plan. The query optimizer is the component of the database management
                        system that performs this optimization.</p>

                    <h3>Types of Query Optimization Techniques</h3>
                    <p>There are several query optimization techniques:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>- Join Elimination</li>
                        <li>- Indexing</li>
                        <li>- Query Rewriting</li>
                        <li>- Query Decomposition</li>
                        <li>- Query Compilation</li>
                        <li>- Query Execution</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Join Elimination</h3>
                    <p>Join elimination is the process of removing joins from a query that are not necessary for the
                        query to return the correct results. This can be done by using indexes or by rewriting the query
                        to eliminate the join.</p>

                    <h3>Indexing</h3>
                    <p>Indexing is the process of creating indexes on the columns that are frequently used in queries.
                        This can speed up the query by allowing the database to quickly locate the rows that match the
                        query criteria.</p>

                    <h3>Query Rewriting</h3>
                    <p>Query rewriting is the process of rewriting a query to make it more efficient. This can involve
                        changing the order of operations in the query or rewriting the query to use a different
                        algorithm.</p>

                    <h3>Query Decomposition</h3>
                    <p>Query decomposition is the process of breaking a complex query into smaller, simpler queries that
                        can be executed more efficiently. This can be done by using subqueries or by rewriting the query
                        to eliminate unnecessary operations.</p>

                    <h3>Query Compilation</h3>
                    <p>Query compilation is the process of compiling a query into an executable form that can be
                        executed by the database engine. This can involve optimizing the query plan and generating
                        efficient code to execute the query.</p>

                    <h3>Query Execution</h3>
                    <p>Query execution is the process of executing the compiled query and returning the results to the
                        user. This can involve reading data from disk, processing the data, and returning the results to
                        the user.</p>

                <div class="question">
                    <h2>Normalization and Denormalization</h2>
                    <p>Normalization is the process of organizing data in a database. This includes creating tables and
                        establishing relationships between those tables according to rules designed both to protect the
                        data and to make the database more flexible by eliminating redundancy and inconsistent
                        dependency.</p>

                    <h3>Types of Normalization</h3>
                    <p>There are several types of normalization:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>- First Normal Form (1NF)</li>
                        <li>- Second Normal Form (2NF)</li>
                        <li>- Third Normal Form (3NF)</li>
                        <li>- Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF)</li>
                        <li>- Fourth Normal Form (4NF)</li>
                        <li>- Fifth Normal Form (5NF)</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>First Normal Form (1NF)</h3>
                    <p>First Normal Form (1NF) is the first step in the normalization process. It requires that the
                        table
                        have a primary key and that each column in the table contain only atomic values.</p>

                    <h3>Second Normal Form (2NF)</h3>
                    <p>Second Normal Form (2NF) requires that the table be in 1NF and that all non-key attributes be
                        fully
                        functionally dependent on the primary key.</p>

                    <h3>Third Normal Form (3NF)</h3>
                    <p>Third Normal Form (3NF) requires that the table be in 2NF and that all non-key attributes be
                        non-transitively dependent on the primary key.</p>

                    <h3>Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF)</h3>
                    <p>Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF) requires that the table be in 3NF and that all determinants be
                        candidate keys.</p>

                    <h3>Fourth Normal Form (4NF)</h3>
                    <p>Fourth Normal Form (4NF) requires that the table be in BCNF and that there be no multi-valued
                        dependencies.</p>

                    <h3>Fifth Normal Form (5NF)</h3>
                    <p>Fifth Normal Form (5NF) requires that the table be in 4NF and that there be no join dependencies
                        on any subset of the candidate key.</p>

                    <h3>Denormalization</h3>
                    <p>Denormalization is the process of adding redundant data to a database to improve read
                        performance.
                        This can involve adding redundant columns to a table or duplicating data in multiple tables.</p>
