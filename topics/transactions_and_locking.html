                    <h2>Introduction to Transactions</h2>
                    <p>
                        A transaction is a unit of work that is performed against a database. Transactions are units or
                        sequences of work accomplished in a logical order, whether in a manual fashion by a user or
                        automatically by some sort of a database program. A transaction is the propagation of one or
                        more changes to the database. For example, if you are creating a record or updating a record or
                        deleting a record from the table, then you are performing a transaction on the database.
                    </p>

                    <!-- Example -->
                    <h3>Example</h3>
                    <p>
                        Let's say you are transferring money from one account to another. The transaction would involve
                        two operations: deducting the amount from one account and adding the amount to another account.
                        Both operations must be completed successfully; otherwise, the database should be rolled back to
                        the state before the transaction started.

            <div id="acid_properties" class="id_topic">
                <div class="question">
                    <h2>ACID Properties</h2>
                    <p>
                        ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) is a set of properties that guarantee that
                        database transactions are processed reliably. In the context of databases, a single logical
                        operation on the data is called a transaction. For example, a transfer of funds from one bank
                        account to another, even involving multiple changes such as debiting one account and crediting
                        another, is a single transaction.
                    </p>

                    <!-- Atomicity -->
                    <h3>Atomicity</h3>
                    <p>
                        Atomicity requires that each transaction be "all or nothing": if one part of the transaction
                        fails, then the entire transaction fails, and the database state is left unchanged. An atomic
                        system must guarantee atomicity in each and every situation, including power failures, errors,
                        and crashes. To the outside world, a committed transaction appears (by its effects on the
                        database) to be indivisible ("atomic"), and an aborted transaction does not happen.
                    </p>

                    <!-- Consistency -->
                    <h3>Consistency</h3>
                    <p>
                        The consistency property ensures that any transaction will bring the database from one valid
                        state to another. Any data written to the database must be valid according to all defined rules,
                        including constraints, cascades, triggers, and any combination thereof. This does not guarantee
                        correctness of the transaction in all ways the application programmer might have wanted (that is
                        the responsibility of application-level code) but merely that any programming errors do not
                        result in the violation of any defined rules.
                    </p>

                    <!-- Isolation -->
                    <h3>Isolation</h3>
                    <p>
                        The isolation property ensures that the concurrent execution of transactions results in a system
                        state that would be obtained if transactions were executed serially, i.e., one after the other.
                        Providing isolation is the main goal of concurrency control. Depending on the concurrency
                        control
                        method, the effects of an incomplete transaction might not even be visible to other
                        transactions.
                    </p>

                    <!-- Durability -->
                    <h3>Durability</h3>
                    <p>
                        Durability means that once a transaction has been committed, it will remain so, even in the
                        event of power loss, crashes, or errors. In a relational database, for instance, once a group of
                        SQL statements execute, the results need to be stored permanently (even if the database crashes
                        immediately thereafter). To defend against power loss, transactions (or their effects) must be
                        recorded in a non-volatile memory.
                    </p>

                <div class="question">
                    <h2>Lock Types</h2>
                    <p>
                        Locks are mechanisms that prevent destructive interaction between transactions accessing the
                        same resource. Locks are used to prevent data corruption and ensure data integrity. Locks are
                        used to prevent two or more transactions from modifying the same data at the same time. Locks
                        are used to ensure that the data is consistent and that the data is not corrupted by multiple
                        transactions.
                    </p>

                    <!-- Types of Locks -->
                    <h3>Types of Locks</h3>
                    <p>
                        There are two types of locks: shared locks and exclusive locks.
                    </p>

                    <!-- Shared Locks -->
                    <h4>Shared Locks</h4>
                    <p>
                        Shared locks are used when a transaction is reading data. Shared locks allow multiple
                        transactions to read the same data at the same time. Shared locks are compatible with other
                        shared locks but are not compatible with exclusive locks. Shared locks are used to prevent
                        transactions from modifying data that is being read by other transactions.
                    </p>

                    <!-- Exclusive Locks -->
                    <h4>Exclusive Locks</h4>
                    <p>
                        Exclusive locks are used when a transaction is modifying data. Exclusive locks prevent other
                        transactions from reading or modifying the data that is being modified by the transaction. An
                        exclusive lock is not compatible with other exclusive locks or shared locks.
                    </p>
